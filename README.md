# â˜• Java Learning Lab â€” From "Hell World" to Hero

> *"First, solve the problem. Then, write the code."*  
> â€” John Johnson

Welcome to my **Java Learning Lab** â€” a space where Iâ€™ll be showcasing my complete journey of learning Java, one class and one project at a time.

This repository documents my path from writing the infamous `"Hell World"` program to building meaningful, real-world Java applications. Every step, concept, challenge, and breakthrough will live here â€” raw, real, and ever-evolving.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Build a strong foundation in **Core Java**
- Master key concepts like **OOP**, **Collections**, **File I/O**, and more
- Apply knowledge through **mini-projects** and **real-world applications**
- Keep my journey transparent, well-documented, and open-source
- Evolve this repo into a **Java portfolio** Iâ€™m proud of

## ðŸš€ My Commitment

I will:
- Learn Java **daily**
- Push updates and progress **consistently**
- Reflect both failures and victories here
- Grow â€” byte by byte, bug by bug

**Stay tuned â€” itâ€™s going to be one hell of a ride.** â˜•
